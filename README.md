# 1. Motivation

This notebook illustrates key concepts from John Hull’s Options, Futures and Other Derivatives using Python.

The goal is twofold:

- to build an applied understanding of derivatives pricing, hedging, and risk management;  
- to create a reference of reproducible examples useful for interview preparation in investment banking and markets.  

The structure broadly follows Hull’s book, with simulations and implementations added whenever a concept benefits from numerical illustration.

# 3. Notes
- This notebook is also a way for me to practice my english finance vocabulary (I'm French/Canadian, so please forgive any small languages quirks).  
- Notations follows Hull's book; if you spot anything unconventional, it's likely due to translation.  
- The organization is evolving : I follow Hull's chapter but add simulations wherever useful.
