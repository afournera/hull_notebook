    "The point of this notebook is to illustrate everything that I feel the need to illustrate when I come across it on John Hull's book $\\textit{Options, futures and other derivatives}$. I hope this file will enlighten every one who founds it, but I especially hope it will englighten me.\n",
    "Also note that I'm a frenchman, and this notebook is also a way for me to familiarize with the english names. Thereby I already appologize if there is any unconventional notation (I doubt that, I believe the translator of the book did a good job) or any english errors throughout all of this\n",
